\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Example Structure:
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the problem of interest and what (high-level) are the current best methods for solving it?
\item How do you plan to improve/understand/modify this or related methods?
\item Preview your research process, list the contributions you made, and summarize your experimental findings.
\end{itemize}


\section{Background}

% Example Structure:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item What information does a non-expert need to know about the problem domain?
% \item What data exists for this problem?
% \item What are the challenges/opportunities inherent to the data? (High dimensional, sparse, missing data, noise, structure, discrete/continuous, etc?)
% \end{itemize}

Deep Neurel Networks (DNNs) have become extremely large in size with growing complexities. A BERT base model has 110M parameters and takes 438 MB disk space to store. This makes it very hard to deploy those models on mobile devices, which in most cases have limited storage and RAM and lower computational resources. The challenge that we are facing is how to compress DNNs in size while keeping their predictive performance competitive with full model.

\section{Related Work}

% Example Structure:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item What 3-5 papers have been published in this space?

We are interested in compressing the language representation model BERT \cite{devlin2018bert}. It is the state-of-art result in many natural language processing tasks such as natural language inference, paraphrasing and named entity recognition.

\cite{cheng2017survey} provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-art methods to compress DNNs. Of the methods summarized by the paper, the ones that are of interest to our work are weight-pruning and quantization \cite{han2015deep}, and low-rank factorization \cite{denton2014exploiting}. Knowledge distillation, first proposed by \cite{bucilua2006model} as ``knowledge transfer'', was recently popularized by \cite{hinton2015distilling}. It differs from the previously mentioned methods since it compresses an existing model by replacing it with a simpler model that is trained on its outputs.

DeepTwist, a end-to-end training framework, allows us to incorporate compression procedures into training \cite{lee2018deeptwist}. Under this framework, the model parameters are occasionally distorted during training time instead of only at the end. This framework has the benefit of simplified training procedure and faster convergence and reduced requirement for hyperparameter tuning. Experiment on MNIST dataset with DeepTwist shows that LeNet-5 and LeNet-300-100 models are able to retain predictive accuracy under high compression rate.

\section{Model}

We first set up some notation. Let $F_\btheta = G_\bpsi \circ \bert_\bphi$ be a
transformed model where
$\btheta = (\bphi, \bpsi)$ be parameters of the subparts of the model.
$\bert_\bphi$ is a BERT model where the pretrained weights are $\bphi_0 = 
(\bphi_0^i)_{i=1}^n$, and
$G_\bpsi$ is additional layers for fine-tuning BERT, parameterized by $\bpsi$.
We decompose the subparts of the model into layers: \begin{align*}
\bert_\bphi &= f_{n}^{\bphi_n} \circ \cdots \circ f_1^{\bphi_1} \\
G_\bpsi &= g_{m}^{\bpsi_m} \circ \cdots \circ g_1^{\bpsi_1}.
\end{align*}

\subsection{DeepTwist-based Weight Distortions}





Example Structure:

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the formal definition of your problem?
\item What is the precise mathematical model you are using to represent it? In almost all cases this will use the probabilistic language from class, e.g.
  \begin{equation}
  z \sim {\cal N}(0, \sigma^2)\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}
But it may also be a neural network, or a non-probabilistic loss,
\[ h_t \gets \mathrm{RNN}(x_{t}, h_{t-1} )\]

This is also a good place to reference a diagram such as Figure~\ref{fig:diagram}.

\item What are the parameters or latent variables of this model that you plan on estimating or inferring? Be explicit. How many are there? Which are you assuming are given? How do these relate to the original problem description?
\end{itemize}

\section{Inference (or Training)}
\label{sec:training}


\subsection{Knowledge Distillation}
\label{subsec:kd}

In this paper, we limit our purview to text classification tasks. Training
neural-network-based systems for this task typically consists of a form of
gradient descent based on a differentiable loss function which takes in the
prediction for a given example and the correct label. That is, if we have
training data $(\bm{x}_i, y_i)$ and model $f$, we would aim to minimize,
\[ \ell(f(\bm{x_i}), y_i)\]
where usually the loss function is taken to be Cross-Entropy loss. When we
already have a model $f$ that performs well, we can leverage this training
paradigm through a modification called \emph{knowledge distillation}. Given the
large model that performs well, termed the \emph{teacher network}, we train a
smaller network $g$, the \emph{student network}, by minimizing,
\[ \ell(g(\bm{x_i}), f(\bm{x_i})).\]
Here, we can no longer use Cross-Entropy loss because $f(\bm{x}_i)$ is a
probability distribution rather than a specific label. However, we can take
$\ell$ to be either mean-square error (MSE) between the probabilities in
log-space, or Kullback-Leibler (KL) loss. We avoid MSE error on the
probabilities themselves because of disappearing gradients when the predicted
probabilities are very close to 0 or 1.
